# Enders_eFlow_Pro_Three_Phase_Mod
I have modified my Enders eFlow Pro to use "Turbo Zone" without disable left heater. Now it is able to heat with 4500W instead of 3000W.
In original state the issue is that a Schuko Plug can't handle more than 3600W and if the heater is cold it draws that power from net. That is the reason why the left heater must disabled if you whant use "Turbo Zone".
So the solution is to use a larger CEE Plug, it can handle 16A per phase. 
If someone copies this, it is at your own risk. I do not accept any liability.


Parts what you need for the Mod:
- 1pcs CEE Plug 16A 5 Pole
- 1m Rubber hose line H07 RN-F 5G2.5 mm²
- 3 pcs flat receptacle 2.5 mm²
- 1 pc ring cable lug M4 2.5 mm²
- 7 pcs cable end sleeves for 2.5 mm²
- clamp for 2.5 mm²
- shrink tubing
